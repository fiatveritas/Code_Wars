# Code_Wars
These python scripts are kata I took up
through Code Wars. 

# Caesar Cipher
This script takes a key and shifts each
letter in a message by the key. Positive
key shifts letter to the right. Negative
number shifts to the left. Shifts are 
based on alphabetical order.

# Determinant of a n_by_n Matrix
This script computes the determinant
of an n_by_n matrix. Expansion by 
first row.

# Sequential Numbers Currently coding
This script defines a function that
takes in a number and returns the 
next number larger than the input
based on the digits in the given 
number.
